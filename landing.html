                        <p>120 years of experience...collectively as a team in TV and film is what we have, and it sets us apart from the rest.  Storytelling through video is the language we speak, it’s who we are, what we love, and having the opportunity to partner with clients to tell their story provides us with genuine satisfaction. Our team has worked in the NYC advertising scene, on Hollywood film sets, network drama series, we’ve made our own independent films, worked as producers, editors, and designers at The Oprah Winfrey Show and basically everything in between. 
There is no shortage of experience here. Our passion and drive has taken Bottle Rocket Media through a decade of storytelling for some of the largest brands in the world and we’re just getting started. The customer experience we offer to our clients is flawless, and seamless. We perfect the project for our clients and we make the video creation process fun. We are your best friends in video. So, there you have it. 
It’s the Rocket Sauce that adds valuable authenticity to how we approach each and every project. It’s our people. </p>
